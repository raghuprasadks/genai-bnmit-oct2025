Topics for Generative AI for 5 day workshop

zero shot
what is llm
compare various llms


I am conducting a 5 days of workshop on Generative AI and Agentic AI. Can you come up with topics for each session. Every day i will be taking six hours session. Note that people from different backgrounds are attending this session

I am a medical professional.
Explain me llm from my profession
perspective

add use cases related to healthcare and logistics

can you suggest some projects which can be developed at the end of the workshop


can you help me in generating code for Patient Symptom Checker Bot

steps
1. create folder structure
workshop->programs->chatbot
2. check python version
open terminal from chatbot folder
in the terminal
python --version
3. open chatbot folder in visual studio code
4. create virtual environment
click on view->terminal
5.create virtual environment 
python -m venv venv
6. activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
7. create 1-cohere-gettingstarted.py
8. replace api key with your api key
9. In terminal 
pip install cohere
10. python 1-cohere-gettingstarted.py
